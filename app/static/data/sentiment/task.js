The absolute rudest most bitter sour people there and the owner is even worse .  A miserablre environment full of staff that hate being there and dont want to talk to you. Overpriced.

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>The hot sauce was fantastically fabulous. The beer was cold and plentiful. So plentiful in fact, that when the waiter poured our glasses, it foamed up and ran all over the table. \n\nSpeaking of the table, it was orange. So orange, it seemed to be proud of its orangeness. The hot sauce and the orange table were the highlights of the meal. \n\nI mean, if you like the colour orange, than this place is for you. And if you like hot sauce that will put hair on your chest, this place is totally for you. The dish even had a few long black hairs already on it, it is that strong, and tasty. \n\nSo, if hot sauce and the colour orange are your thing, try this place. Or, if you are in to table beer, hairy dishes, and pizza that is quicker than Delissio and almost as tasty, then you may want to try it.</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

The way the shop is set up is it\'s open so you can always see your pet being groomed nothing is behind closed doors. It\'s very reassuring. \nGrooming skills are amazing.

The door was already unlocked and the Manager George was ready to greet us. He explained the store set up carefully and let us ask questions. He was knowledgeable and took the time to get to know us to determine the best fit. We left that day and visited 3 other stores and did online research. What brought us back the following Wednesday was our great experience with George. It was a big purchase for a newlywed couple, and we are confident it was the best deal.

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>Wow what a foodie experience.  I was transported to Mumbai! The decor is simple and trendy. We went on a Sunday night and called ahead for a table. It was crowded with about 3 tables unoccupied and the rest perhaps 20 or more occupied.  There was pictures of India scattered on one wall opposite a cool list of \"rules\" such as no phones, no flirting etc. and a cool elephant with sunglasses.  Lighting was dark and music was a little loud but it added to the ambience and was warm and inviting. Service was excellent and attentive with multiple people assisting with taking orders, drinks, changing plates and checking in on us. The food was exceptional!  We had the pappadum plate to begin and lobster samosa and they were perfect appetizers.  Food took about 30 minutes to arrive so I recommend having appetizers and spreading out the meal.  The flavours were all so amazing that the tasting menu may be the way to go next time.  We didn\'t as we were dining with our 2 teens.  We also had 1 basmati rice, 2 garlic naans, the prawn curry, chicken Tawa and butter chicken.  The tawa chicken was a little spicy but perfect in every way with a beautiful curry with white chicken and potatoes.  The butter chicken was traditional and the perfect mix of sweet, tomato based and spices.  It truly was an amazing meal.  With 5 juices and a pop and bottled water it came to $115 including service which is included on your bill.  I tipped on top even though it says no tipping because I was just amazed by everything. The manager checked in on how we enjoyed the meal. We had a few left overs as well.  One of the best Indian food meals I have had in Toronto and I will definitely return!</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},
        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>I have been going to this facility for almost a year. The staff is nice and friendly. Very easy to make appointments and they accept walk ins too.\n\nThe reason for the poor rating is based on my recent experience with my 9 year old golden retriever. He was coughing for few days,had trouble breathing and stopped eating, the vet did a chest X-ray on him and diagnosed with a Kennel cough. I did tell the vet that he did have kennel cough before but was never this lethargic and was still eating. My concerns were dismissed and we were sent home with medication.\n\nMy pet\'s condition worsened over the weekend, we noticed his tongue was almost purple in color, we rushed him back on a saturday night. Our pet stayed their overnight, they were not sure what was wrong with him. They ran all kinds of tests on him and next morning we were presented with a bill for almost 1500 dollars, with no diagnosis. Dr. Messenger came and spoke to us and said we are not sure what was wrong with him and asked us to go to another ER. We ended up taking out pet to CARE at Latrobe Drive. Dr.Dvorak quickly diagnosed him with Pnuemothorax and he ended up having surgery to have part of his lung removed.\n\nI am just appalled at the Vet at Long Animal who took a chest X-ray on him and could not see his chest was full of air. We will never be going back.</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

This is a - I know what what I want, pick it up and GTFO while waiting in line to cash out forever.\n\nI can\'t encourage Walmart since they are the badass retailer in the world - I rather not support the devil of mass merchandisers. I would much rather pay more **or price match** at other places to get the same things\n\nThink about it.\n\nHope this helps,\n-jT</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>Mani and Pedicure experience\nFacts:\n1. On arrival the woman try to overcharge me for a acrylic overlay for manicure. She stated that it was $35. I asked for a price list and the price was $25. \n\n2. When requesting pedicure she try to give a higher option. I had to inform her I wanted to recieve the basic. She did not like this and as a result put little effort in my pedicure. The paint job is sub par. She even failed to remove polish that dripped on my feet. \n\n3. I was not really happy about my color on manicure set. When I told the lady that I may want to change it, she got an attitude. I kept the color on my nails for the sake of peace.\n\nThe lady that I spoke with about price should work on being honesty and respect customer wishes on service.  She not try to pressure them for the higher price services. The manicurist should have patience with customers who may need time to choose color.  Overall, I am disappointed in the first lady because she was intially dishonest and did not do a good job on my pedicure. I felt it was done out of spite.The second lady did a good job.\n\nI gave 2 star rating because of the workmanship and dishonesty of the first lady. \nEven though, I was not completely satisfied. I left a tip. I will not be returning to this shop.\n\nTip to future visitors, always ask for the price list.</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>Love this place.  Been here many times and loved it every single time.  I have brought my children here and  met with girlfriends here.  It was always a pleasant experience.  One of the times I came with a friend, she wanted her pasta a certain way and they told her they would make her pasta anyway she wanted it with whatever she wanted to put in the sauce.  Not many restaurants cater to clients like that!  It turned out delicious!  I usually have their pizza which is thin crust and always scores big with everyone I bring.  Ignore the bad reviews and try this place.  Well worth it.\n\nUPDATE:  I revisited this place a couple years ago (2104) and they had moved from their original location. Very nondescript venue with little ambiance. Food had declined in value and taste. Will not visit again.</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>I have a \"special needs\" cat. Aka that means he needs bladder expression once a day and extra cleaning needs, In addition he is high energy so he needs to be entertained quite a bit shall we say. My cat is not a patient at the hospital but after the care they gave him I am giving it serious consideration. I dropped him off on a Friday and the doctor met with me to discuss his needs and what he eats and what my concerns were while I was out of town. I picked him up Monday night and he was as happy as a clam. Well as happy as a cat can be in a place full of strange dogs and cats. They made sure his special needs were taken care of and he was in better shape than when I dropped him off. I will say this is a very difficult task since he is special needs. I loved how(Dr. Whitten Jr.) talked to me about Mojo and how him and his dad took care of Mojo over the weekend. I would take Mojo back for boarding and for regular care in the future based on my experience. This place is busy but they do not make you feel like a number like most large places do.

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>So today I decided to try a new nail place because the one I usually go to is typically packed on the weekend. That nail place I decided to try was Popular Nails. When I first arrived the man greet was very welcoming, he asked me what I wanted done, which I initially said was a full set and to take off my old ones, he said okay to give him a minute. So I sat there and I waited for about 35 minutes before he got me in the chair. When I sat down, he said that he can do a fill because they weren\'t too bad, and a nail repair because during that time I pulled off one of my middle finger nails. He asked me what color I wanted, I said French in the gel. As he was doing my nails, it all seemed fine. After he finished putting the new acrylic on and filing them I told him if he could square them off more because he made them round for some odd reason. Long story short, when he finished putting the white tip color on my nails after I had completed dried with the UV light, I looked at my nails and I noticed that they were all uneven, the shapes were different, the white tips on each individual nail did not align to one another. It was just a complete mess. I asked him to fix them and he proceeded to tell me that he could not fix them because he already sealed then and it would make the gel come off. And while he was saying it he caught the worst attitude ever. I paid and left. At this point I\'m beyond furious because I hate when I have to pay for things that I\'m not satisfied with and things that are not how they should do! My advice to you guys is to NEVER go to this nail salon. The man does a terrible job, gets mad if you ask him to fix them and then you walk out disappointed!</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},

Unsure as to why this place has received such great reviews, the jerk\"sauce\" was more like soy sauce and the chicken was not grilled, I don\'t even want to get started on what appeared to be the Uncle Ben boxed rice. The beef patties and cocoa bread were just bad bad bad. If you think this is authentic Jamaican food , you are extremely misinformed.

        {"question": ["What is the sentiment of this review?","<i>I have known Dr. Richard Killough since the \'70\'s and he is absolutely the BEST! He and his son, Dr. Brian, truly love animals and it shows in the care and time they take when I take my 4 dog children in for a visit.  They take the time needed to answer my questions with any concerns I might have.  I always get a return call when I leave a message on their VM.  One night near closing time, my Great Dane\'s stomach twisted and I recognized her symptoms and I called and talked to Dr. Brian and he waited on me so he could do emergency surgery even after a long day at the clinic.  Donna\'s life was saved and I will be eternally grateful for Dr. Richard Killough and Dr. Brian Killough who performed the late night surgery.  Our other 3 dogs have had many, many surgeries and Dr. Richard Killough always calls several times to follow up to make sure they are doing OK.  I can\'t tell you how much I appreciate those calls.  Even when I have had to say good bye to one of my babies, there is so much care and concern and I mean true concern.  Both the Killough\'s are a true asset to their profession and to Long Animal Hospital.

They have a number of mini puff pastries flavours so while I figured I should only have one (trying to be good) the worker advised that they sell the mini pastries in sets of four. Well, I couldn\'t argue with that!   I\'ll take the apricot, sour cherry, chocolate and apple & vanilla pudding ones then.  The pastries were all flakey and were like two-bite puffs.  The sour cherry wasn\'t really sour but did taste like cherry and I didn\'t care for the sourness anyway so that worked for me.  I had the chocolate & cherry consecutively and thought that they should have a chocolate cherry puff - now that would be good!\nThe 4 pastries were only $2.50 - a great price, especially for a place in the Path. \n\nNote: They also offer savoury puffs.</i>"],"options": ["Negative","Neutral","Positive"]},
